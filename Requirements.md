# Requirements

Please make sure, you've the following items installed on your laptop before the event, for the workshop section.

1. Google Chrome

2. Node v9.4.0, NPM v5.6, Yarn v1.3

   - [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
   - [Installing Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

3. Node Dependencies

   Install the **create-react-app** dependence.
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

4. Code Editor, of your choice

If you're unable to use Node or its dependencies. You can instead use [CodeSandbox]( https://codesandbox.io) as a fallback option, in your browser.

For anyone, who needs a refresher on JavaScript. I recommend you read the excellent [Re-introduction guide to JavaScript]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).
