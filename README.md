# Introduction to ReactJS

React is a front-end library developed by Facebook. It's used for handling the 
view layer for Website, Native Mobile Apps and VR. ReactJS allows you to create 
reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript 
libraries out there. With a strong foundation and a large community behind it.

This talk will discuss what is ReactJS. How and where you can use it. Followed 
by a workshop, where we will learn, how to build a component-based web-app 
using ReactJS.

## Workshop

When you download either version of the project. Please run `yarn install` to 
install the project dependences.

- [Incomplete Version](./Workshop/Incomplete)

  This simple and incomplete version was built during the workshop. All of the 
  important code is in the `src/App.js` file.

  I've heavily annotated this files with comments explaining the code.

- [Completed Version](./Workshop/Completed/)

  This completed version is slightly more in-line with how I would go about 
  implementing this.

  There are 3 files in this version that are important.

  - `src/App.js`
  - `src/Form.js`
  - `src/Card.js`

  I've heavily annotated these 3 files with comments explaining the code.


## Notes & Reference

  Once you're through the workshop code. I highly recommend going through the 
  Quick Start guide for ReactJS.
